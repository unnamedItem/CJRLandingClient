Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their &quot;native&quot; currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EIn Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EThe money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EPlayers with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external &quot;wall&quot; section within their complex.

      "description": "THE GAME CONCEPT\u003Cbr/\u003EYou are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books. To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EOUTLINE OF GAME PLAY\u003Cbr/\u003EThe object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or fewer Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EGAME CHARACTERISTICS\u003Cbr/\u003EThe game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck. The rules are easy to understand, but you have to play it a few times to develop a playing strategy. It plays differently from 2-4 players, but each game is equally fun and challenging.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E",

      "description": "In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003ESet-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EA turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EPoints are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003ECATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EDie Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector&#039;s edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

Each player starts the round with a hand of eight cards, with one player (the oldest) receiving the guard bug &ndash; which stays on the table throughout the game &ndash; and one card being turnd face-up to start a discard pile. The cards are numbered 1-5, with the majority of them having only numbers; some cards have special abilities that come into play when added to the discard pile or in a player's hand.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EOn a turn, a player places one card from her hand onto the discard pile; that card must be numbered exactly one higher or lower than the card on top of the discard pile.

If a player can't play a card, she draws one from the deck and her turn ends.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EThere's another way to rid yourself of cards, though: cheating! Throughout the round, you can make cards disappear by dropping them on the floor, hiding them up your sleeve and so on. You must keep your hand of cards above the table at all times, you can't vanish more than one card at once, and you can't rid yourself of your final card this way. The player with the guard bug &ndash; and only him! &ndash; can call out other players for cheating, and no one can cheat while the accusation is being resolved. If the accusation was false, the Guard must draw a card; otherwise the cheating player takes back the card she tried to lose, is given a card from the Guard's hand as additional punishment, and becomes the new Guard.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003ECheating is a necessity as the &quot;Cheating Moth&quot; cards can't be played onto the discard pile, but must be disappeared via cheating.

Only the fastest player gets to leave her card in place.\u003Cbr/\u003E    Mosquito: After a mosquito is played, everyone but the active player must slap the pile of cards. Whoever is slowest receives a card from the hand of all other players.\u003Cbr/\u003E    Spider: After playing this, give a non-Cheating Moth card from your hand to another player.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EWhen one player has no cards in hand, the round ends.

Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points.

Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EThe goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round.

      "description": "Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game. Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EWhat causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EWith multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.\u003Cbr/\u003E For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EFrom the publisher's website:\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EDare to discover Forbidden Island!

      "description": "Formula D is a high stakes Formula One type racing game where the players race simulated cars with the hope of crossing the finish line first.  This is a re-release of Formula Dé with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EThe game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a &quot;stop&quot; rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. \u003Cbr/\u003E Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EHowever, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EFormula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a &quot;Dashboard&quot; with movable pegs to manage your car&rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with &quot;Character&quot; profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of &quot;Fuel&quot; for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EThe popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula Dé Mini), and a lot of &quot;after market&quot; parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E",

With all players playing at the same time, someone reveals a card, then players grab for the &quot;right&quot; object &ndash; but which object is right?\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E    If one object is colored correctly &ndash; say, a green bottle and a red mouse &ndash; then players need to grab that correctly colored object.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E    If both objects are colored incorrectly &ndash; say, a green ghost and a red mouse &ndash; then you look for the object and color not represented among the four details shown. In this case you see green, red, ghost and mouse, so players need to grab the blue book.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EThe first player to grab the correct object keeps the card, then reveals the next card from the deck.

You want to be present in all of these areas, preferably at just the right time to maximize your earnings. The gameboard features 109 spaces, with one card in the deck for each of those spaces.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EAt the start of a round, each player receives a hand of five cards. Each player chooses a card from hand, then passes the remaining cards to the next player, then each player plays their card in turn, beginning with the round's start player and typically placing a diamond-shaped token of their color in the location depicted on that card:\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E     In the Workshops, you score 1 point for each of your tokens in a connected group with the newly placed token, doubling that score if you played on a pigment field.\u003Cbr/\u003E     In the Residences, you score the listed number of points, and if your token is preceded in the line by one or more tokens of your color, you score those previously played tokens again.\u003Cbr/\u003E     In the Townspeople area, you score 1, 3 or 6 points based on the height of your token in the pyramids, but you can only place at higher levels if the lower spaces are filled. Double your points if the card symbol matches the space your filled. Supporting tokens score again as higher tokens are placed.\u003Cbr/\u003E     In the Trade shops, four types of goods are present, and when you place a token, each token on that goods type scores for its owner points equal to the number of goods of that type now covered.\u003Cbr/\u003E     In the Harbor, you move your ship equal to the number on the played card, scoring points based on the space where you land, then place a token in one of the five rows. When that row is filled with three ships, each token in that row scores for its owner 1/3/6/10 points depending on the number of trade goods in that row.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EAlternatively, you can play a card for ship movement points and not place a token on the game board.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EEach player plays four cards in a round (in a 3 or 4 player game), then adds the last card in hand to those displayed beside the game board, then the start player marker rotates and you begin a new round.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EFor each of the five areas, you can meet a certain condition that allows you to play a bonus card from those beside the game board, e.g., in the Workshops when you place the third card that surrounds a bonus card symbol, or in the Trade shops when you score a goods type that gives someone else more points than you. When you play a bonus card, you might trigger another bonus card... and then another!\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EAdditionally, there are five different ways to score substantial bonus points for the areas, e.g., in the Residences you need to place tokens on houses of four different values, and in the Townspeople area you need to place tokens on all three types in a pyramid. You can only score each area's bonus once, and importantly each time a bonus is claimed then the value available for later players is reduced.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EWhen someone has placed their final diamond token or when you can't deal a new hand of five cards to each player, then the game ends and the player with the most successful glass dynasty (most points) is declared the winner.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E",

      "description": "Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EDuring a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EAfter a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EEach month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EDuring the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EPart of the Pandemic series\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E",

Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EPlayers simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too. Once you have finished drawing and guessing &ndash; and you're not required to do either &ndash; take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions. Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EOne by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made. Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table. Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep &ndash; the player who made the worst guesses. If a single player has more cards in the center of the table than anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What's more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep &quot;bonus&quot; and all the scoring tokens you didn't give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EReset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round.

It's an experiment, a journey, a team experience in which you can't exchange information, yet will become one to defeat all the levels of the game.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EIn more detail, the deck contains cards numbered 1-100, and during the game you try to complete 12, 10, or 8 levels of play with 2, 3, or 4 players. In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EYou start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. You start with one shuriken as well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level. As you complete levels, you might receive a reward of a shuriken or an extra life. Complete all the levels, and you win!\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EFor an extra challenge, play The Mind in extreme mode with all played cards going onto the stack face down.

We are the Resistance!\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EThe Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EPlayers are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies.

Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission.

The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and take turns performing actions by placing their dice onto the board. Players may choose from a variety of actions, each require the use of one or more dice: collecting resources or money, acquiring contracts, traveling on the map or using a special action granted by a city. When traveling, each player begins at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a player stops at a city, they place a trading post there, giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game. The higher the value of the dice used for an action, the better the options that may be chosen, but also the more money the player must pay if an opponent has already chosen the same action.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EAfter five rounds, the game ends with players receiving extra victory points for having trading posts in Beijing, fulfilling the most contracts, and having trading posts in the cities on secret goal cards that each player gets at the start of the game.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003EThis game should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which has the same German title.\u003Cbr/\u003E\u003Cbr/\u003E",

There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game.
